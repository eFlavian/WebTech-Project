Using the following resources given by the professor: [Project Theme](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzTXvrZzQhO3ZD_IscU1ENIuYZPhqeq-/view "1") and [General Requirements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AiR2R2noX24zzfWu0-DvcV9Wt1lF-jTl/view "2")

Our team will create a web application for transport reviews that has a RESTful backend that accesses data from a relational database and an external service using a persistent API, as well as an SPA front end created using a component-based framework.
While the two files the professor gave us include a complete description of the future web application, I believe we should start discussing how it will be created. Prior to reviewing the code and approving or rejecting the modifications, each of us will have a separate branch on this repository. When someone solves a problem, he or she will commit the changes to that branch. This way, we can keep the evidence of what each of us did, easier.

Most likely, the professor will be a contributor and the github repository will be set to private, but we'll need to talk about this.

The initial concept for the app is to create some profiles and assign roles to each user who registers. Each type of user will have access to various functionalities based on that.
